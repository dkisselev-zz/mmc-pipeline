The brain barrier is critical in maintaining homeostasis, controlling influx and efflux transport and regulating waste clearance. However, the specific role of the brain barrier in linking periodontitis to cognitive function remains unclear.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">A murine model of periodontitis-induced cognitive impairment was constructed via oral topical application of <i>P. gingivalis.</i> Neuroinflammation was observed by detecting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and glia activation. Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to detect the expression of tau-related molecules and neuronal loss. WB, Evans blue staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function including the infiltration of <i>P. gingivalis</i> and immune cells, and BBB permeability. The changes of meningeal lymphatic drainage were observed using an in vivo animal imaging system and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect of <i>P. gingivalis</i> on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) was further verified using IF and RT-PCR.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\"><i>P. gingivalis</i>-induced periodontitis exacerbated cognitive impairment by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and glia activation. In the brain of periodontitis mice, p-Akt and p-GSK3β levels were reduced, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss including cell bodies and neurites. <i>P. gingivalis</i>-induced periodontitis enhanced BBB permeability, promoted P. gingivalis and immune cell infiltration, and downregulated the expression of Occludin and ZO-1. In addition, the meningeal lymphatic drainage was impaired and the mRNA levels of lymphangiogenesis-related factor LYVE1 were decreased in the dura matter of periodontitis mice. After <i>P. gingivalis</i> infection, the inflammatory response was increased, and LYVE1 and ZO1 expression was decreased in LECs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Periodontitis aggravated neuroinflammation and neuronal loss which was associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. The impaired meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLV) and disrupted BBB affected the brain barrier function, further inhibiting the clearance of pathogenic substances and enhancing immune cell infiltration in periodontitis mice. These results indicated that brain barrier dysfunction may be the link between periodontitis and cognitive impairment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2025 Jiang, Xu, Zhao, Shen, Qiu,

Subgingival dysbiosis leads to the aggregation of highly pathogenic bacteria, and the host's genetics modulates the innate immune response.

            "INTRODUCTION: Concurrent with infants' progression in dietary complexity and gut microbiome diversity, infants gradually change their defecation patterns during the first year of life. However, the links between bowel habits, the gut microbiota and early life nutrition remain unclear. The primary outcome is to characterise the gut microbiome development from birth to 1 year of age. Second, to investigate how bowel habits and nutrition in early life relate to the gut microbiome and metabolome during this period of life, and to explore how the development of the gut microbiome associates with host development.\n",

            "METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The MOTILITY Mother-Child Cohort (MOTILITY) is a Danish prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolling up to 125 mother-infant dyads. Assessments occur at 36 weeks gestation (visit 1), birth (screening of infant) and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (±2 weeks) post partum (visits 2-5). At visit 1, maternal anthropometrics, self-collected faecal and urine samples, and questionnaires on bowel habits and lifestyle are obtained. Between visits, infant faecal (biweekly), urine (monthly) and maternal breast milk (monthly until 6 months of age) samples are collected at home, and bowel habits and dietary intake are assessed biweekly by self-reported questionnaires. At visits 2-5, infant blood and saliva samples are collected, and anthropometric measurements are obtained. In addition, dietary intake is recorded thrice throughout the study period for mother and infant, respectively, and infant whole-gut transit time is estimated by sweet corn tests at 9 and 12 months of age. Birth, growth, motor development, sleep patterns, tooth development, overall health and well-being are assessed using questionnaires.

            "Microbes start colonising the infant’s oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract at birth, with subsequent gradual development and establishment of oral and gut microbiomes during infancy.17 These microorganisms play an essential role in human health by supporting several physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism and the maturation of the nervous and immune systems.1 5 8 Various perinatal and postnatal factors influence the establishment and development of the infant gut microbiome,9 including maternal health,10 mode of delivery,1113 gestational age,14 15 intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis,1618 postnatal application of antibiotics,1719 breastfeeding,20 as well as exposure to parents,21 siblings and pets,2224 along with hospital25 and domestic environments.26 While there is a growing appreciation that nutrition in early life strongly affects the development of the infant gut microbiome,27 28 which is linked to metabolic, hormonal, mental and immunological development,1 5 29 the underlying interplay between dietary patterns, gut microbiome development and host physiology remains elusive.\n",

            "Diet is the most fundamental and decisive factor driving the composition and development of the gut microbiome during the first year of life.20 28 30 31 The initial infant diet is liquid-based in the form of breast milk and/or formula milk, each affecting the gut microbiome differently. Breast milk, rich in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), promotes the growth of Bifidobacterium species.203234 These have been suggested to support metabolic functions accommodating changes in amino acid levels in breast milk27 and to influence the oral microbiome.7 35 Formula milk has been shown to induce a difference in gut microbial diversity and composition compared with the bifidobacteria-dominated gut microbiome in breastfed infants.20 31 36 37 The different feeding regimens have also been linked to differences in gut bacteria-derived metabolites,38 including short-chained fatty acids (SCFAs).39 40 As infants begin complementary feeding (CF) around 4–6 months of age, their gut microbiome undergoes significant changes during the transition from milk to solid foods. While CF is essential for health and development, its impact on gut microbiome development has been less studied.41 42 Research shows that CF, and in particular the cessation of breastfeeding, alters gut microbial composition and metabolites,404345 but previous studies often captured dietary patterns at only one or a few time points,28 limiting insight into the gradual changes.\n",

Indeed, gut transit time in adults has been found to associate with the gut microbiome diversity and functionality.51 Furthermore, recent studies have shown that microbiota-derived products, such as SCFAs and biogenic amines,52 can affect gut motility,5356 primarily through specific receptors found in intestinal cells.57 Although it is well established that defecation patterns change during infancy,46 47 the links to diet and gut microbiome remain elusive in the context of early life.\n",

            "Gut microbes and microbial-derived metabolites affect the development of the immune system in early life.58 For example, a study on Swedish infants showed that infants lacking Bifidobacterium species had improper immune development.45 Additionally, aromatic lactic acids produced by Bifidobacterium species are suggested to affect immune function in early life.5962 Impaired immune development in infancy can lead to a higher risk of immunological diseases in childhood,45 63 influenced by microbial composition, diet-derived metabolites and microbial metabolites.64 65 Thus, investigating the associations between early life nutrition, gut microbiome development and immune system markers is essential. Biomarkers of the immune system, such as cytokines, immune cells and antibodies, in faeces and blood can provide insights into immune development and be linked to the gut microbiome development.66\n",

A mechanistic study showed that antibiotic exposure can impair growth by transferring infant gut microbiomes exposed to antibiotics to gnotobiotic mice.70 These effects on growth may extend into childhood and adolescence.71 Neurological development has similarly been linked to gut microbiome development,72 affecting motor skills,73 74 memory,75 cognition29 76 and language.29 77 Behavioural measures like crying time78 79 and sleep patterns80 have likewise been linked to the infant gut microbiome.

Descriptive statistics of mothers and infants will be presented as either means with SD if normally distributed, or as median and IQR if abnormally distributed, as well as counts and percentages. Additionally, data visualisation tools will be used to graphically depict the data. The data will be integrated by use of linear mixed models, repeated measures correlation and multivariate analyses considering the longitudinal study design. Adjustment for multiple testing will be applied.

            "The MOTILITY Mother-Infant cohort stands out due to its biweekly longitudinal stool sampling, along with frequent recordings of dietary patterns and bowel habits during the first year of life. The study will make a significant contribution to the scientific community by deeply examining the role of early life nutrition and bowel habits in shaping the infant gut microbiome, as well as exploring the connections between infant gut microbiome development and host physiology, including gut motility. By uncovering diet-microbiome-host associations in infants, we may identify new mechanisms by which nutrition, via microbiota-dependent and microbiota-independent pathways, influences intestinal motility and other physiological measures. Additionally, the cohort study will provide insights into how diet-microbiota interactions relate to metabolic, hormonal, mental and immunological development in early life, which could be crucial for lifelong health. The inclusion of extensive metadata, such as socioeconomic status, delivery mode and sleeping patterns, will enhance the study’s predictive power and enable more nuanced analyses. However, some limitations to the study should be mentioned. First, while self-collection of biological samples allows for higher sample frequency enabling the study of the incremental changes in the infant gut microbiome, the quality of samples might be compromised due to possible variations in sampling procedures and storage at home, despite thorough instructions provided to minimise these differences. Second, the study does not follow the development of the infant gut microbiome until it reaches maturity, which typically occurs between 2 and 3 years of age.6 Third, the explorative nature of the study should also be mentioned. While novel hypotheses are likely to be generated from the cohort study, external validation using data from other infant cohorts such as CIG,89 MILQ,90 SKOT91 and INFANTMET92 and/or dedicated mechanistic in vitro and in vivo experiments is needed. We recently applied such a framework using a similar infant cohort including 25 infants, which was followed from birth to 6 months of age. Despite the relatively low sample size, the longitudinal design enabled us to identify novel diet-microbe-metabolite associations, which we later validated using data from other cohorts and mechanistic experiments.60 93 This underlines the potential of combining a longitudinal infant cohort with mechanistic follow-up experiments to discover important and novel diet-dependent gut microbial metabolites, which may be pivotal mediators of host physiology in early life.\n",
